Connoisseur has continued to develop and expand its portfolio increasing the type and number of services it offers, whilst maintaining its commitment to offering a high quality professional and highly dedicated logistical solution. The last seven years has seen the Asian market develop into a huge consumer of wine. We have responded to this by adding scheduled LCL refrigerated ocean services to:</p>

                            <p>Connoisseur is one of the largest consolidators for the movement of alcoholic beverages to Asia. The shipment of wines to mainland China, however, is something entirely different…? The UK is a secondary market for wine and although as a nation we have fantastic allocations of some of the world’s finest wines you simply cannot just collect and fly the goods. China has strict rules and regulations in place for the movement of alcoholic beverages in order to satisfy the criteria dictated by Chinese customs and CIQ, the buyer and seller must first have made the appropriate contract. The buyer must have the relevant license in place to import wines and the seller must be able to provide the correct documents in original format. Meeting the appropriate conditions as dictated by the buyer and in line with customs and CIQ rules and regulations, the submission of these documents must be approved in advance. If and when this criteria is met, the wines being imported all approved with Chinese back labels affixed a shipping date and method approved and prepared, shipment can proceed. The Chinese market is challenging to service but not impossible, however, it must be done correctly. The local agent’s knowledge and support is vital as China CIQ often select bottles for sampling, these can be removed for sampling and not returned. Connoisseur are happy to assist with your enquiries and provide help to ensure the correct conditions are met. </p>

Our commitment to providing our customers with a service, that is not only reliable but goes beyond that of our competitors, which is best explained via our new IT system.This enables our customers to view and track the progress of each and every part of their consignment, from the initial release to us processing the releases through pick up and checking in, departure, arrival and delivery, with complete and total transparency. At Connoisseur we believe that you are important and should have control, we want you to see every part of each transaction. We believe that our experience and commitment to evolve, change and to be the best that sets us apart.

                            <p>At Connoisseur we spend countless hours researching the viability of shipping alcoholic beverages to certain countries. India is a market that we all wish to serve. Duties and Taxes have always been an obstacle to trade although those figures have become somewhat more balanced they are still very high. As a rule of thought, shipment of Alcoholic Beverages to India currently can only be made to those with prior approval of the wines or spirits they wish to import, in the event that the enquiry is a licensed entity. Connoisseur can arrange shipment by both Air and FCL Ocean. </p>

                            <p>It is with great with excitement that we introduce our new service to Malaysia. At Connoisseur we ensure that any service has been extensively researched and that the on the ground support logistics are in place to ensure a smooth shipping experience. Malaysian based clients have until recently used Singapore for the placement of their wines and although this still takes place the need for a direct and professional delivery service was apparent. Connoisseur now operate a twice monthly direct British Airways service to Kuala Lumpur and beyond, supported with local on the ground customs clearance and onward temperature controlled delivery to the final destination. We are also able to offer an express service for those people that do not wish to utilize the consolidation programme. These services are supported by our in-house computer systems and enables our Malaysian clients to view their stocks online and select those that wish for us to consolidate and dispatch. As with all our services we are able to collect and consolidate purchases made by client from all over Europe for onward shipment in addition to this service we also offer a DOOR TO DOOR delivery service for Langkawi this is important as it is a location within Malaysia that is base to many luxury yachts and thus being able to provide a fully managed delivery to this location is of added benefit to our clients.</p>

                            <p>Southern & Central America is generally considered a difficult region for the placement of wines and alcoholic beverages. Restrictions with regard to the personal importation of wines and spirits and the legislation in place in the various countries that make up Southern & Central America can make the importation of beverages be perceived to be impossible. This is not the case but we must be mindful of the regulations adopted by these countries and to this end we work together with local licensed importers and agencies to ensure the beverages are dispatched with correct documentation, and that the entire listing has been presented and approved in advance. We do offer a full door to arrival airport service for this continent and will research and advise our clients of the required mandatory documents and local legislation. Shipments of beverages to companies who hold licenses and permits are not a problem and we can prepare shipments either by Air or Refrigerated FCL container. We continue to develop links with agencies throughout this continent so that we may be able to offer clients who reside in these countries the opportunity to procure wines for personal consumption. In addition we also offer a service to the Falkland Islands, this service is Door to Door. </p>

                            <p>Spain richly deserve its place at the top table in the wine hierarchy. Whether it’s the fabulous yet incredibly hard to acquire Dominio de Pingus or the historic winery of Vega Sicilia, both of which originate in the Ribera region, or the relative newcomers from the Bierzo region including the Descendientes De J Palacios and Alvaro Palacios L'Ermita, this is of course supported by the wines from Rioja region which continues to produce wines of real quality.

We remain the only specialist wine forwarder with our office CID CONNOISSEUR ASIA licensed to carry wine and spirits.

We recognised quickly the need to have our own people with the ability to offer customers the potential to import as many cases as they would like, free from the process of applying for their own licenses, thus creating safe secure and controlled shipping environment. We offer door to door air and refrigerated LCL & FCL services for both wines and whiskies. We utilize direct EVA AIRWAYS twice weekly Airfreight services from London and quarterly LCL refrigerated ocean services. FCL refrigerated services can be arranged as and when required. Our ability to prepare both Certificates of Origin, Age Certificates and detailed comprehensive invoices, together with our fantastic new IT and software package, make Connoisseur the only choice for your precious purchases. As the market in Taiwan matures and the needs and tastes of their people change, we are confident Connoisseur can continue to both meet and exceed their expectations, whilst maintaining our commitment to provide the complete service from start to finish. </p>
